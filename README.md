## Prerequisite
A working installation of [MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)

  * npm
  * [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

## Module behavior
This module has been programmed to allow for multiple instances. Simply add more MMM-DLijn config entries to your config.js file to display multiple stations and configure them according to your needs.

## Configuration
Sample minimum configuration entry for your `~/MagicMirror/config/config.js`:

    ...
    
    {
        module: 'MMM-DLijn',
        position: 'top_left',
        header: 'stopName' // At the moment this is a manual (optional)
        config: {
			stopID: '',		// Which stop would you like to have displayed?			
        }
    } 						// If this isn't your last module, add a comma after the bracket
    
    ...

Sample configuration entry for your `~/MagicMirror/config/config.js` with optional parameters:

    ...
    
    {
        module: 'MMM-DLijn',
        position: 'top_left',
        header: 'stopName'  // At the moment this is a manual (optional)
        config: {
			stopID: '',		// Which stop would you like to have displayed?
			maxConn: 6,		// How many connections would you like to see? (Maximum: 10)
			lines: '',		// What lines are you interested in?
			labelRow: true, // Show or hide column headers
		    reload: 60000 	// How often should the information be updated? (In milliseconds)
        }
    } 						// If this isn't your last module, add a comma after the bracket
    
    ...
